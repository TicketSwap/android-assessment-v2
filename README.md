# TicketSwap Android Assessment

As you know our business is centered on events like concerts and festivals. We love bringing people together to enjoy the best artists and events.
As you probably know by now, since the Zombie Virus breakout we cannot do this anymore, people have to stay far away from each other for this nightmare to end.
But that does not mean we are defeated, in fact we decided that we should put our brains at work to help with this unprecedented catastrophe, and started working on an app to help with the vaccination process.
Nobody likes Zombies. We want to bring people back to concerts, and it would be nice if they didn't eat each others!

One of our Android developers started working on a basic app to enable people to:
- Get informed about the vaccines
- Choose one of the available vaccines
- Book an appointment to the nearest vaccination center

Unfortunately they were bitten while coming to the office, they knew they had not much time left so, heroically, they completed the first version of the app while slowly turning into a zombie. We wish them a prompt recovery, but at this time we cannot rely on their coding skills for obvious reasons.

That's why we need your help.

In this repo you will find the code for the app, we would like you to perform a code review and give us your expert opinion on several topics about the quality of the code. We do not need you to write or rewrite any part of it, just tell us what you think of it.

- Is the code compliant with Android best practices?
- Do you see anything you would do differently? Why?
- Is the code easy to understand?
- Any other thoughts?

## How to review

Please add your comments inside the code above/close the relevant lines.
For more generic comments, please add a list of points above the MainActivity class definition.
Once you are done, zip the whole project and sent it to us.

Thank you and Good luck!
